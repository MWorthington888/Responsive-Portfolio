        <p>I find myself in Chicago, now some 16 years, by way of St. Louis, Mo. With two Bachelors degrees (Mass
          Communications from Southern IL Univ Edwardsville and Biology from Northeastern Illinois), I'm off pursuing
          another career as a web developer.
          This is not my first foray into programming, as I studied Basic and COBOL back in high school, before the
          world ever heard of "Windows".</p>

        <p>Currently in a full-stack programming certification bootcamp at Northwestern University, I'm immersed
          in a sea of CSS, Bootstrap, React and Node.js. We are fortunate to also delve into the latest programming
          technologies.<p>

            <p>Upon completion of the class in April 2019, I hope to secure a position as a junior web developer with a
              company that needs my skills, but in turn, can teach me and help me grow as a developer and programmer.</p>

            <p>During my downtime, my wife and I travel Europe whenever possible. And I'm always on the lookout to
              expand
              my tiki mug collection.</p>
